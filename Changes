Revision history for Perl extension Games::Go::SGF.

0.01  Sun Sep 30 12:54:47 2001
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-XA -n Games::Go::SGF

0.02  Fri Nov 24 16:00:04 2006
	- second version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-XO -n Games::Go::SGF
Changes:

1. Report 'bad go sgf' with an explanation if:
there are certain duplicated property identifiers (tags) 
within a file (eg SZ),
there are certain duplicated tags within a node (eg B),
there is a certain mixture of tags within a node 
eg ( (B or W) and (AB or AW or AE) )

2. Quietly re-organise tags within a node if it is badly formed.
eg CR[aa]CR[ab] becomes CR[aa][ab]

3. Added AUTOLOAD functions to SGF::Node and SGF, so property values can be 
found from the sgf tag. eg. $sgf->RU.

4. Added $sgf->colour to report the move colour

5. Added $sgf->tags, that returns a list of the tags found in a node.

6. Added some validation checks to the values associated with some tags.

Fixed problem with CR[aa]CR[ab] becoming CR[aa][ab]CR[aa][ab]

0.11  Sun Oct 26 2008

If the sgf contains more than one game record, the first game is now parsed,
and any others ignored, rather than than whole thing not parsing.
